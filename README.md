### We're looking for more developers!

See [here](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/Diamond-drops/wiki/Introduction-and-onboarding-process-for-new-developers) for information.

### Introduction

For an introduction to Ethereum, see https://ethereum.org/ or https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-introduction.

For an introduction to WIP sharding implementations, see https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-and-stateless-client-implementations.

### Why Rust?

After comparing Rust, C++, Go, Javascript and Python, as well as corresponding implementations (Parity, cppethereum, Go-ethereum, ethereumJS and Py-EVM), Rust and Parity seem like they are most preferable. Rust has advantages such as safety, concurrency, practicality, better memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and support for functional and imperative-procedural paradigms.  It also is compatible with Wasm. More details are here: https://gitter.im/ewasm/Lobby?at=5a92381135dd17022eedc444. Additionally, [Go is not compatible with Wasm at present](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18892), so [Go-ethereum isn't either](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16192). However, Wasm isn't very practical at the moment with its MVP, e.g. it doesn't support parallel threads and other feautures, but it is planned to support other languages and these features.

### Further information

This repo and the Drops of Diamond project it belongs to is not a part of or owned by the Ethereum Foundation, nor is it endorsed by the Foundation. A different project name and logo may be used (the logo could use a more modern design rather than just using a photo in the public domain), and alternative proposals are welcome. The Drops of Diamond project is not legally incorporated as of yet, so legally it is not an organisation. That should be done, but probably only as needed once the project is more well-developed.
